        <h1>Emphasis and strengthened text</h1>
        <body>When I woke up today I <em>showered</em> and ate my breakfast. I had <strong>eggs and toast.</strong> After class I went home to complete an <em>online midterm.</em> After the midterm I was <strong>very hungry</strong> so I had some steak and rice.</body>

    <section id="2">
        <h2>... Seperating content from presentation</h2>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <body>The tags "em" and "strong" are better tages than "i" and "b" because they are more descriptive of what the action is. Strong tells you that the text will appear strong whereas b could mean anything.</body>
