        <h1><strong> Old Fashion </strong> Vs <strong>Desktop Publishing</strong></h1>
        <section> 
            <h3>The Use Cases</h3>
            <p>One difference between old fashioned typewriting, desktop publishing, and html/css is the use cases of them. Old fashioned typewriting is primarily used for print media like news papers or letters. Desktop publishing is used for digital content or print media since it can be printed or viewed online. CSS and HTML are primarily used for digital content like websites and articles since people use the code for their own digital work that is not printed out for use. </p>

            <h3>Formatting</h3>
            <p>How you format the text in each style is also very different. Typesetting has the least amount of options and the metal keys need to be chnaged in order to have different formatting for text. For desktop publishing you can change the formatting of the text in the application very easily. Usually this is through buttons you can press and follow a quick process to insert something like an image. For CSS and HTML you must code the styling into the text and check the formatting after so see if what you did was correct.</p>

            <h3>Output of systems</h3>
            <p>A similarity between HTML/CSS, Desktop publishing, and old fashioned typesetting is the output of all the systems. All of them in some form will output a section of text, with headers, and pictures. Although colour, formatting, and size might vary, the general structure of the text will come out the same.</p>
