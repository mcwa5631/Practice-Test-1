        <h1> Writing in Google Docs vs HTML</h1>
        <p>Writing in Google Docs and HTML is very different for three reasons. Firstly, how you format text. Secondly, because of how you must check your text output. Thirdly, the functions available with using each one. </p>
        <h3>Text Fromatting</h3>
        <p>One difference between writing in Google Docs Vs an html document is that in Google Docs you can automatically assign special chaarcters and format them however you want using the top toolbar. In html you must use code to format text such as "strong" to bold words. </p>
        <h3>Text Output</h3>
        <p>Another difference in html is that you must contsanly refresh your website in order to see how your text appears. In Google Docs you can just see the results of what you typed out. </p>
        <h3>Functions Available</h3>
        <p>Google Docs has many different functions available for users to type out whatever they need. Using these functions is also much easier because of the simple buttons and symbols used to represent the functions. If you want to past an image all you need to do is click a couple buttons and you can paste an image. For HTML you must remember all the diffeent code in order to use the functions and it is more difficult than Google Docs.</p>
